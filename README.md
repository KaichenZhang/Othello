# Othello

This project is an implementation for Othello game. It provides a simple command line interface to interact with our "Robot". You can specify different heuristic strategies, and load game from plain text with fixed format. Further work is required to provide a much more user-friendly interface.

Othello project is also for COMP6721 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence group project in 2016 Fall.
